c. Use a variable named winner to represent if anyone has won yet.

d. Use a variable named tie to represent if the game has ended in a tie.*/

/*------------------------ Cached Element References ------------------------*/

b. In a constant called messageEl, store the element that displays the gameâ€™s status on the page.*/

/*-------------------------------- Functions --------------------------------*/
/* a. Create a function called init.

b. Call the init function when the app loads.
c. Set the board variable to an array containing nine empty strings ('') representing empty squares.
d. Set the turn to X - this will represent player X.
e. Set the winner to false.
f. Set tie to false.
g. Call a function named render() at the end of the init() function.

b. Create a function called updateBoard.

c. In the updateBoard function, loop over board and for each element:
Use the current index of the iteration to access the corresponding square in the squareEls.
Style that square however you wish, dependent on the value contained in the current cell being iterated over
d. Create a function called updateMessage.

e. In updateMessage, render a message based on the current game state:

If both winner and tie have a value of false (meaning the game is still in progress), render whose turn it is.
If winner is false, but tie is true, render a tie message.
Otherwise, render a congratulatory message to the player that has won.
f. Invoke both the updateBoard and the updateMessage functions inside your render function.
